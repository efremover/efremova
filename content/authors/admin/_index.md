Jana Efremova is a PhD student researching the impact of ocean acidification, a mainly anthropogenic driven environmental stressors, on marine ecosystem stabilities at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. In particular, she analyzes the microbial and chemical ecology of marine sponges and their impact on nutritional cycles. Her research interests include ecology, metabolism, biochemistry and nutrition. Her academic specialisation is focused on nutritional sciences and biochemistry, however the current PhD position allows her a interdisciplinary integration of her knowledge and a contribution to Climate Change research.
